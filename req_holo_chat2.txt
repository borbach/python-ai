Perfect! I've enhanced your Hologram Creator with the requested features:

## ðŸ”§ **Key Improvements:**

### 1. **Always Visible Hologram**
- **Split-pane interface**: The chat now uses a two-pane layout with the hologram always visible on the left
- **Live status indicator**: Shows "Online", "Thinking...", etc.
- **Persistent hologram display**: Your merged hologram remains visible throughout the entire chat session

### 2. **Merged Hologram Creation**
- **Smart merging algorithm**: 
  - **Single image**: Creates a beautiful circular hologram with holographic glow effect
  - **Multiple images**: Arranges them in a circular pattern around a central point
- **Holographic effects**: Adds a subtle blue glow around the merged image to make it look more hologram-like
- **Circular masking**: All images are properly masked into circular shapes for a cohesive look

### 3. **Enhanced Interface**
- **Larger window size**: Increased to 1200x800 to accommodate the hologram display
- **Better layout**: Left pane shows hologram + personality, right pane shows chat
- **Improved visual feedback**: Status indicators and better color coding
- **Responsive design**: The hologram resizes appropriately for the chat interface

### 4. **Technical Improvements**
- **Updated API model**: Now uses `claude-sonnet-4-20250514` (the correct current model)
- **Better image processing**: More robust image handling with proper error checking
- **Enhanced personality integration**: The hologram's personality is more prominently displayed

## ðŸš€ **How to Use:**
1. Run the program and create a new hologram
2. Select up to 5 images - they'll be automatically merged into one composite hologram
3. Set personality traits
4. Start chatting - your hologram will always be visible on the left side!

The merged hologram will appear as a beautiful composite of all your selected images, creating a unique digital being that you can chat with while always seeing their holographic form!
