I see the response was cut off. Let me continue explaining the decision matrix and additional features:

## Decision Matrix (continued):

- **80%+ Score**: APPROVED (Low Risk, Prime Rate 4.5-6.0%)
- **65-79%**: APPROVED WITH CONDITIONS (Medium Risk, 6.5-8.0%)
- **45-64%**: CONDITIONAL APPROVAL (High Risk, 8.5-12.0% or require co-signer)
- **Below 45%**: DECLINED (Very High Risk)

## Advanced Features:

**Automated Calculations:**
- Debt-to-income ratio including projected loan payments
- Loan-to-value ratio for collateral assessment
- Monthly payment estimation using standard amortization
- Risk-based interest rate suggestions

**Smart Risk Assessment:**

- Provides specific recommendations for improvement
- Identifies red flags (high DTI, poor credit, criminal history)
- Suggests mitigation strategies (co-signers, additional collateral)

**Professional Reporting:**
- Detailed assessment breakdown by category
- Timestamp and applicant summary
- Financial ratio analysis
- Specific recommendations for loan officers
- Export functionality for documentation

**User-Friendly Interface:**
- Organized tabs for different information types
- Dropdown menus for standardized inputs

## How to Use:

1. **Fill Personal Info**: Age, employment, family status, criminal record
2. **Enter Financial Data**: Income, expenses, credit score, assets, debts
3. **Specify Loan Details**: Amount, term, purpose, collateral
4. **Click "Evaluate Application"** to generate the assessment
5. **Review Results** in the dedicated tab
6. **Export Report** for documentation

The system mimics real bank underwriting processes while being educational and transparent about the decision-making criteria. It's designed to help understand the complex factors that banks consider when making loan decisions.

Would you like me to modify any specific aspects of the system or add additional features?
