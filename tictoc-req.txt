I'll create a Python Tkinter tic-tac-toe game where you can play against the computer. The computer will use a smart strategy to try to win or block you.I've created a complete Tic-Tac-Toe game in Python using Tkinter! Here are the key features:

**Game Features:**
- **Visual Board**: 3x3 grid of buttons that clearly show X's and O's
- **Smart AI**: The computer uses strategy to either win or block you from winning
- **Game Status**: Shows whose turn it is and game results
- **Win Detection**: Automatically detects wins, losses, and ties
- **New Game**: Button to reset and start over
- **User-Friendly**: Clean interface with colors and emojis

**How it Works:**
1. You play as X (blue), computer plays as O (red)
2. Click any empty square to make your move
3. The computer will automatically respond with its move
4. The game detects winners and ties automatically
5. Use "New Game" to reset the board

**Computer AI Strategy:**
1. Try to win if possible
2. Block you from winning
3. Take the center square
4. Take a corner
5. Take any remaining spot

To run the game, save the code as a `.py` file and run it with Python. The game window will appear and you can start playing immediately!

The computer is programmed to be challenging but fair - it will try its best to win while giving you a good game experience.
