I'll create a Python program that lets users select a PDF file and converts it to JPG images. This program will use a GUI file picker and handle multi-page PDFs by converting each page to a separate JPG.I've created a comprehensive PDF to JPG converter program for you! Here's what the program does:

## Features:
- **GUI file picker** - Opens a file dialog to let you select the PDF file
- **Multi-page support** - Converts each page of a PDF to a separate JPG image
- **Output directory choice** - Option to save files in the same folder as the PDF or choose a different location
- **High quality conversion** - Uses 150 DPI for good image quality
- **Progress feedback** - Shows conversion progress in the console
- **Error handling** - Handles various errors gracefully with user-friendly messages

## Requirements:
Before running the program, you'll need to install the PyMuPDF library:
```bash
pip install PyMuPDF
```

## How it works:
1. Run the script
2. A file dialog opens to select your PDF file
3. Choose whether to use the same directory or select a different output folder
4. The program converts each page to a JPG file
5. Success/error messages are displayed in popup dialogs

## Output naming:
- Single page PDFs: `filename.jpg`
- Multi-page PDFs: `filename_page_001.jpg`, `filename_page_002.jpg`, etc.

The program includes comprehensive error handling and user feedback, making it easy to use even for non-technical users. Just save the code as a `.py` file and run it!
