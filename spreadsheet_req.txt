I'll create a Python program that provides a spreadsheet with an API that can be used by external LLM programs. This will include cell manipulation, mathematical functions, and a REST API interface.I've created a comprehensive Python program that provides a spreadsheet with a full REST API that can be accessed by external LLM programs. Here are the key features:

## Core Spreadsheet Features:

**Cell Operations:**
- Set/get individual cells with automatic type conversion
- Support for standard spreadsheet cell references (A1, B2, AA10, etc.)
- Cell metadata tracking (value, formula, last updated)
- Clear cells and validate cell references

**Range Operations:**
- Set/get ranges of cells (e.g., A1:C5)
- Bulk data insertion with 2D arrays

**Mathematical Functions:**
- **Row Operations**: Sum and average entire rows or row ranges
- **Column Operations**: Sum and average entire columns or column ranges  
- Automatic detection of numeric values
- Skip empty/non-numeric cells in calculations

## REST API Endpoints:

**Basic Operations:**
- `GET /api/health` - Health check
- `GET /api/info` - Spreadsheet information
- `GET /api/cell/<cell_ref>` - Get cell value
- `POST /api/cell/<cell_ref>` - Set cell value
- `DELETE /api/cell/<cell_ref>` - Clear cell

**Range Operations:**
- `GET /api/range?start=A1&end=B2` - Get range values
- `POST /api/range` - Set range values

**Mathematical Operations:**
- `GET /api/sum/row/<row>` - Sum row
- `GET /api/sum/column/<column>` - Sum column
- `GET /api/average/row/<row>` - Average row
- `GET /api/average/column/<column>` - Average column

**Advanced:**
- `GET /api/export` - Export entire spreadsheet
- `POST /api/bulk` - Perform multiple operations in one request

## Example API Usage for LLMs:

```python
import requests

# Set cell values
requests.post('http://localhost:5000/api/cell/A1', json={'value': 100})
requests.post('http://localhost:5000/api/cell/A2', json={'value': 200})

# Get cell value
response = requests.get('http://localhost:5000/api/cell/A1')
print(response.json())

# Sum a column
response = requests.get('http://localhost:5000/api/sum/column/A')
print(f"Sum of column A: {response.json()['sum']}")

# Bulk operations
bulk_ops = {
    "operations": [
        {"type": "set_cell", "cell": "B1", "value": 50},
        {"type": "set_cell", "cell": "B2", "value": 75},
        {"type": "sum_column", "column": "B"}
    ]
}
response = requests.post('http://localhost:5000/api/bulk', json=bulk_ops)
```

## Key Features for LLM Integration:

1. **RESTful API**: Standard HTTP methods with JSON responses
2. **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error messages and validation
3. **Flexible Data Types**: Automatic conversion of strings to numbers
4. **Bulk Operations**: Efficient batch processing
5. **Cell Reference Validation**: Supports standard spreadsheet notation
6. **Mathematical Functions**: Built-in sum and average calculations
7. **Export Capability**: Full spreadsheet data export
8. **Thread-Safe**: Can handle concurrent requests

## Installation Requirements:

```bash
pip install flask pandas numpy
```

## Running the Server:

```bash
python spreadsheet_api.py
```

The server will start on `http://localhost:5000` and provide a full REST API that any LLM program can use to interact with the spreadsheet, perform calculations, and manipulate data programmatically.

You're getting a 404 error because Flask needs proper error handling and the server might not be starting correctly. Let me fix the code with better error handling and a more robust server setup:Now the code has been improved with better error handling and debugging information. Here's what I fixed:

## Key Improvements:

1. **Added a root endpoint (`/`)** that shows API documentation
2. **Better error handling** with 404 and 500 error handlers
3. **CORS support** for cross-origin requests
4. **More robust server startup** with proper exception handling
5. **Local testing function** to verify functionality before starting the server
6. **Clear URLs and documentation** displayed when starting

## To run the server:

```bash
python spreadsheet_api.py
```

## Test these URLs after starting:

1. **Root documentation**: `http://localhost:5000/`
2. **Health check**: `http://localhost:5000/api/health`
3. **Spreadsheet info**: `http://localhost:5000/api/info`

## Quick API Test Commands:

```bash
# Test health endpoint
curl http://localhost:5000/api/health

# Set a cell value
curl -X POST http://localhost:5000/api/cell/A1 \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"value": 100}'

# Get a cell value
curl http://localhost:5000/api/cell/A1

# Sum a column
curl http://localhost:5000/api/sum/column/A
```

## Common Issues and Solutions:

1. **Port already in use**: Change the port in `run_server()` from 5000 to another port like 5001
2. **Permission denied**: Try running with `python3` instead of `python`
3. **Missing dependencies**: Install with `pip install flask pandas numpy`

The updated code now includes comprehensive error handling and should give you clear feedback about what's going wrong if you still get errors. The root endpoint (`/`) will show you all available endpoints and examples of how to use them.


You're getting the API documentation page, which means the server is working correctly! The 404 error you experienced earlier was likely because you were trying to access an endpoint that didn't exist.

Now that the server is running on `http://localhost:5000`, you can test the actual API endpoints. Here are some examples:

## Test the API endpoints:

**1. Health Check:**
```
http://localhost:5000/api/health
```

**2. Spreadsheet Info:**
```
http://localhost:5000/api/info
```

**3. Set a cell value (requires POST request):**
You'll need to use a tool like curl, Postman, or write a Python script:

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:5000/api/cell/A1 \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"value": 100}'
```

**4. Get a cell value:**
:wq```
http://localhost:5000/api/cell/A1
```

## Simple Python client to test the API:Perfect! Your server is running correctly. The page you're seeing at `localhost:5000` is the API documentation page, which means everything is working.

Now you can test the actual API functionality. I've created a test client that you can use to interact with your spreadsheet API.

## To test the API:

1. **Keep your server running** (don't close the terminal with the server)

2. **Open a new terminal/command prompt** and run the test client:
```bash
python api_test_client.py
```

3. **Or test individual endpoints in your browser:**
   - Health check: `http://localhost:5000/api/health`
   - Spreadsheet info: `http://localhost:5000/api/info`

## Example using curl (if you have it):

```bash
# Set cell A1 to 100
curl -X POST http://localhost:5000/api/cell/A1 \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"value": 100}'

# Get cell A1
curl http://localhost:5000/api/cell/A1

# Check health
curl http://localhost:5000/api/health
```

## For LLM Integration:

Your API is now ready for LLM programs to use! An LLM can make HTTP requests to:

- **Set data**: `POST /api/cell/A1` with JSON `{"value": 100}`
- **Get data**: `GET /api/cell/A1`
- **Calculate sums**: `GET /api/sum/column/A`
- **Calculate averages**: `GET /api/average/row/1`
- **Bulk operations**: `POST /api/bulk` with multiple operations

The test client I provided shows exactly how an external program (including LLMs) would interact with your spreadsheet API. The server is working perfectly - you just need to use the correct endpoints rather than the root documentation page!
