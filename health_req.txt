I've created a comprehensive Health Plan Program using tkinter and Python! Here are the key features:

## Program Features:

**Age Group Dropdowns:**
- **Infants**: 0-3 months, 3-6 months, etc. up to 5 years (in 3-month increments)
- **Children**: Individual years from 5 to 20 years old
- **Adults**: 5-year ranges from 20-24 up to 95-100 years

**Core Functionality:**
- User selects age group and clicks "Get Recommendations"
- System generates comprehensive, evidence-based medical recommendations
- Displays results in a scrollable text area
- Clear disclaimer about AI-generated content
- "Print PDF and Exit" button creates a professional PDF

**Medical Recommendations Include:**
- Nutrition and lifestyle guidance
- Immunization schedules (CDC-compliant)
- Regular check-ups and screenings
- Preventive care measures
- Age-specific health priorities
- Mental health considerations
- Safety recommendations

## Required Dependencies:

You'll need to install these packages:

```bash
pip install reportlab
```

The program uses standard Python libraries (tkinter is built-in) plus ReportLab for PDF generation.

## Key Safety Features:

- **Prominent medical disclaimer** warning users to consult healthcare professionals
- **Age-appropriate recommendations** based on medical guidelines
- **Professional PDF output** with disclaimers and timestamp
- **Clear, organized presentation** of health information

The program provides comprehensive, age-appropriate medical recommendations while maintaining important safety disclaimers. The PDF output is professionally formatted and includes all necessary warnings about consulting healthcare professionals.

Would you like me to modify any aspect of the program or add additional features?
I see the issue! The error is in the PDF generation code where I incorrectly used `tk.datetime` instead of importing the `datetime` module separately. Let me fix that:Perfect! I've fixed the error by:

1. **Removing unused imports** (`requests` and `json` that weren't being used)
2. **Adding the correct datetime import** (`import datetime`)
3. **Fixing the datetime reference** in the PDF footer from `tk.datetime.datetime.now()` to `datetime.datetime.now()`

The error occurred because I mistakenly tried to access `datetime` as an attribute of the `tkinter` module (`tk.datetime`), but `datetime` is a separate Python module that needs to be imported independently.

Now the PDF generation should work correctly and create a professional PDF with a proper timestamp footer showing when the recommendations were generated.

Try running the program again - the "Print PDF and Exit" button should now work without any errors!
