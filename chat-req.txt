I'll create a simple chatbot for you in Python. This will be a basic conversational bot that can respond to various user inputs with predefined responses and some basic pattern matching.I've created a Python chatbot for you! This chatbot comes in two versions:

## Features:

**Simple Chatbot:**
- Basic pattern matching for common phrases
- Random responses from predefined categories
- Recognizes greetings, farewells, thanks, questions about time, etc.
- Simple and easy to understand

**Advanced Chatbot:**
- All features of the simple chatbot plus:
- Remembers your name when you introduce yourself
- Keeps track of conversation count
- Additional response categories (jokes, weather, personal info)
- Occasionally uses your name in responses for a more personal touch

## How to use:
1. Run the script
2. Choose between simple (1) or advanced (2) chatbot
3. Start chatting! Type 'quit', 'exit', or 'stop' to end the conversation

## Key components:
- **Pattern matching**: Uses regex to identify user intent
- **Response categories**: Organized responses by topic
- **Random selection**: Picks random responses to feel more natural
- **Conversation loop**: Continuous chat until user decides to quit

The chatbot is designed to be friendly and conversational. You can easily extend it by adding more patterns and responses to the dictionaries. Would you like me to modify anything or add specific features?
