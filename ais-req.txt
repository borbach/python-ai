Great. Now create for me with python and tkinter a life insurance approval system. It should ask the relevant questions, such as amount, term, age of insured, occupation, physical health, any diseases, family history, medications, any surgeries, blood pressure, and any other relevant details you would recommend and then show and print a report whether to give the applicant life insurance.

Now create a tenant approval expert system with python and tkinter. It should evaluate a tenant based on credit score and credit history, current income, stability of job, cost of rent, past referrals from other landlords, criminal history, and any other criteria that you think would be helpful.
