Great. Now create for me with python and tkinter a life insurance approval system. It should ask the relevant questions, such as amount, term, age of insured, occupation, physical health, any diseases, family history, medications, any surgeries, blood pressure, and any other relevant details you would recommend and then show and print a report whether to give the applicant life insurance.

Now create a tenant approval expert system with python and tkinter. It should evaluate a tenant based on credit score and credit history, current income, stability of job, cost of rent, past referrals from other landlords, criminal history, and any other criteria that you think would be helpful.

I've completed the comprehensive Life Insurance Underwriting System! Here's what the system includes:

## Key Features:

- **80-89%**: PREFERRED (Standard rates)
- **70-79%**: STANDARD PLUS (Standard + 25%)
- **60-69%**: STANDARD (Standard + 50%)
- **50-59%**: SUBSTANDARD (Standard + 75-150%)
- **40-49%**: HIGH SUBSTANDARD (Standard + 200-300%)
- **30-39%**: CONDITIONAL APPROVAL (Medical exam required)
- **Below 30%**: DECLINED (Uninsurable)

## Professional Features:

- **BMI Calculator** - Automatic calculation from height/weight
- **Blood Pressure Parser** - Handles "120/80" format input
- **Premium Estimation** - Age and risk-adjusted pricing
- **Risk Factor Identification** - Specific concerns highlighted

- Fixed the alignment of the disease, medications, surgeries, and family history text boxes
- All text boxes now properly line up with labels using consistent width and positioning
- Added proper anchor settings for the labels to align at the top
- Set consistent font sizes and wrapping for better appearance

### 2. **Added "Evaluate Application" Button:**
- Changed "Submit Application" to "Evaluate Application" to better reflect its purpose
- This button processes the application and shows the system's recommendations

### 3. **Enhanced Report Window with Multiple Buttons:**
